# PyTimeVar: A Python package for Trending Time-Varying Time Series Models
Authors: Mingxuan Song, Bernhard van der Sluis, Yicong Lin

## Purpose of the Package

The PyTimeVar package offers state-of-the-art estimation and statistical inference methods for time series regression models with flexible trends and/or time-
varying coefficients. The package implements nonparametric estimation along with multiple new bootstrap-assisted inference methods.
It provides a range of bootstrap techniques for constructing pointwise confidence intervals and simultaneous bands for parameter curves. 
Additionally, the package includes four widely used methods for modeling trends and time-varying relationships. 
This allows users to compare different approaches within a unified environment.

The package is build upon the methods of several papers and books. We list the key references below.

## Getting Started

The PyTimeVar can implemented as a PyPI package. To download the package in your Python environment, use the following command:
```python 
pip install PyTimeVar
```
